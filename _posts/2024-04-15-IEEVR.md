Last month we participated in the IEEEVR conference in Orlando, with some posters and demos from our eXtendedRealityLab at Nokia. Our Owl prototype provided the visitors of our demo with their very first teleporting experience, and in some cases seasoned with a disturbing out-of-body experience ðŸ˜Š. It was very encouraging to see the good reception of our immersive communication concept based on video in such a relevant forum. Most people confirmed the potential, provided feedback and additional ideas; the application field seems to be endless.
