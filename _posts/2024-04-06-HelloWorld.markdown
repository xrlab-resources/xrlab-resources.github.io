We are the eXtended Reality Lab, a group of researchers in Nokia focused on the application of immersive technologies (XR) to the improvement of human communication. Rather than playing with the Metaverse we use state of the art XR to teleport people from one place of the real world to another one. We call this the Realverse: our goal is abolishing the physical distance as a barrier for personal communication. To do it we capture in real time pieces of the world at different spots, segment them and merge all together in a blend of reality where all participants feel present. It is not Virtual, Augmented or Mixed Reality: it is effectively a “Distributed Reality”. The practical implementation of this idea requires a pretty complex mix of XR, Artificial Intelligence and a powerful 5G/6G network, a quite challenging task. And we have fun attempting to solve it!
