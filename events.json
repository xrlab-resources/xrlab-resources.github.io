  "description": "Our collaboration with Colegio Base keeps getting good results. This time we went there with an updated version of our nice \"DRictionary\", a Distributed Reality version of the popular Pictionary implemented with VR plus video pass-through. Although our ML based segmentation is now fully functional we required a portable version on multiple HMDs, so we leveraged the opportunity to include chroma segmentation in Quest2. Result was great, kids had a lot of fun and we got interesting results for our research",
