  "description": "Tech Talk is a program in which selected CNS people give an internal keynote about a technical topic of interest for the company. XRLab was asked to participate, and it happened in this slot, where Alvaro Villegas presented the main research focus of the lab with \"The Realverse: the XR killer app for 5G and beyond\". The presentation included the motivation, the concept, its taxonomy and practical considerations about its implementation and value for Nokia. Positive feedback!",

The workshop explains to the students the motivations and tricks for achieving a pretty difficult goal (at least in Spain): doing researc in the industry. The provided example is, of course, XRLab, with its whole history from the BL days to the current success within CNS.",

  "description": "Our collaboration with Colegio Base keeps getting good results. This time we went there with an updated version of our nice \"DRictionary\", a Distributed Reality version of the popular Pictionary implemented with VR plus video pass-through. Although our ML based segmentation is now fully functional we required a portable version on multiple HMDs, so we leveraged the opportunity to include chroma segmentation in Quest2. Result was great, kids had a lot of fun and we got interesting results for our research",
